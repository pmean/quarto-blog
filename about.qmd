Professor Mean is the alter-ego of Steve Simon on the Internet. For those who don't get the joke, I point out that Professor Mean isn't just your average professor.

A bit of history. I started writing web pages in December of 1998. Most of the pages were informational handouts that I prepared for one client and which I thought might be useful to others. I'd write two or three pages a week. Sometimes a bit more and sometimes a bit less. Over the years, this has amounted to well over two thousand pages.

The quality of the pages is uneven, with some pages nicely formatted and others very rough around the edges. I am working on a transition to a blog format using Quarto, but I am keeping the old pages around for a while, at least until the transition is complete.
